livius - a Qt-based TLCV-compatible live chess viewer

Hi all,

I decided to release sources to my Qt-based TLCV-compatible client, perhaps it may be useful to someone.
I don't plan to work on it anymore (nothing stellar - in fact I hacked it together rather quickly some time ago).
I'm not sure if I cleaned up the source properly so there may be some unfinished pieces of code that can be safely removed.

The link is here: https://github.com/kmar/livius

License is zlib.

There is one annoying bug (going out of sync) that needs to be fixed (workaround is to simply reconnect in that case).
As for the protocol, I RE-d it so I'm not sure if it's ok to release the sources, but I will risk it. I'm ready to close the sources should there be legal problems,
but I hope Thomas wouldn't mind as he's no longer active...


Have fun.

Oh and the default piece set is ugly but I'm not an artist.
